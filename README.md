# My AoC 2025 Solutions
## Day 1
Got bored so decided to rewrite part 2 in python, and then rewrote part 2 as a python one-liner

## Day 2
I had never used regex before today so it took me a bit gg :skull:

## Day 3
I like this solution, was getting a few off-by-one errors while coding though.

## Day 4
This is some of the worst code I've ever written...

## Day 5
Part 2 couldn't be brute forced but I didn't check before coding a solution… I then started coding Inclusion-Exclusion without checking how many intervals there was (it would have been 2^182 numbers to add lol)
